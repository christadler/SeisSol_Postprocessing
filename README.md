# SeisSol_Postprocessing
Postprocessing steps for DT-Geo workflow

## Step 3: Postprocessing scripts
Run script on the outputs directory of SeisSol_ParamStudies

Depending on your setup, you might need to:
* adjust the path to SeisSol
* adjust the conditions of the for-loop for fewer/more catalogue entries
* adjust the path of the directory in which the outputs from the previous block are stored
